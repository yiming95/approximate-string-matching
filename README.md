# Approximate string matching 
A python project that implements 6 approximate string matching algorithms and then to analyse the dataset.


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Introduction

The breif introduction of the project.

```
The program implements 6 approximate string matching methods: 
• Global edit distance
• Local edit distance
• Bigram algorithm
• Trigram algorithm
• Soundex
• Metaphone

and then evaluate them to generate precision, recall.

The dataset files that support it to generate results are： dict.txt, wiki_misspell.txt and wiki-correct.txt. 
After running the program, it will generate six new files contains predicted words for each method. The precision and recall are shown in the terminal.

Wikipedia contributors (n.d.) Wikipedia:Lists of common misspellings. In Wikipedia: The
Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia: Lists_of_common_misspellings&oldid=813410985

The program imports three packages from Internet:

- editdistance: source: https://github.com/aflc/editdistance

- nltk: source: http://nltk.org 

- jellyfish: source: https://github.com/jamesturk/jellyfish
```

## To run it

* Using command "python project1.py"
