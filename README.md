### Introduction

The breif introduction of the project.

```
The program implements 6 approximate string matching methods: 
• Global edit distance
• Local edit distance
• Bigram algorithm
• Trigram algorithm
• Soundex
• Metaphone

and then evaluate them to generate precision, recall.

The dataset files that support it to generate results are： dict.txt, wiki_misspell.txt and wiki-correct.txt. After running the program, it will generate six new files contains predicted words for each method. The precision and recall are shown in the terminal.
